We built a control panel that was used to power and relay information to the control system after wiring up a pressure, level, and flow meter in addition to an RTD. The pressure sensor was an electromagnetic meter. The level sensor was radar, and the flow meter was a Coriolis. The RTD was a 3-wire (2-red, 1-white).
We wired them up to a control panel that used IO Charms that were connected to the DeltaV system to relay information back to the control system after commissioning the instruments.

The following table details information about the equipment installed in the UO Lab classroom:

|Instrument|Tag|Manufacturer|Model|Key Process Parameters|
